<h1>What is HTML?</h1><b></b><p></p><b></b>
<br>
<em><p>Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory.<br></p> In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.<br>

    HTML is the language in which most websites are written.<br> HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.<br>

    The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS<br> and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial.<br> For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.
